  >>steps:  
  
  >>This is a novel approach for image completion that results in images that are both locally and globally consistent.With a fully-convolutional neural network, it can complete images of arbitrary resolutions by filling-in missing regions of any shape. To train this image completion network to be consistent,It use global and local context discriminators that are trained to distinguish real images from completed ones.
